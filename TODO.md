# TODO (Event Link)

## High
- [x] DX: align docs/scripts with React+Vite UI (remove stale legacy tooling references; fix `start.bat`).
- [x] Docker: add `ui/Dockerfile` + `ui/.dockerignore` + SPA nginx config so `docker compose up --build` works again.
- [x] React UI: add organizer upgrade flow (invite code) wired to `POST /organizer/upgrade`.
- [x] React UI: add “Resend registration email” action wired to `POST /api/events/{id}/register/resend`.
- [x] React UI: add “My calendar (.ics)” download wired to `GET /api/me/calendar` (auth required).
- [x] Fix Student Profile interest tag toggling (avoid double-toggle when clicking the checkbox).
- [x] Localization (RO/EN) for UI labels and outbound emails with Accept-Language support.
- [x] [EL-3] Student signup: allow students to create an account with email + password so they can register for events.
- [x] [EL-4] User login: allow both students and organizers to log into their account securely to use the platform.
- [x] [EL-6] Organizer create event form: provide a form for organizers to create and publish new events.
- [x] [EL-12] Enforce capacity limits: automatically stop new registrations when an event reaches its maximum number of seats.
- [x] [EL-13] Student event list: show a list of all upcoming events on the main page so students stay informed about what’s happening.
- [x] [EL-14] Event details page: when a student clicks an event in the list, show a full details page (description, time, organizer, location, etc.).
- [x] [EL-15] Event registration button: on the event details page, show an “Enroll / Register” button for logged‑in students to reserve a spot.
- [x] [EL-21] Event tags for recommendations: allow organizers to add relevant tags to events so the recommendation engine can match events to interested students.
- [x] [EL-22] “Recommended for you” section: show students a personalized list of recommended events based on their registration history.
- [x] Add Alembic migrations and replace `AUTO_CREATE_TABLES` in production; generate migration for cover_url/attended columns.
- [x] Harden auth: central organizer/student dependency helpers, consistent JWT expiry validation, and rate limit login/register.
- [x] Implement global exception/response wrapper for consistent error payloads (code/message) across APIs.
- [x] Add organizer invite approval audit trail (store who/when upgraded, not just code).
- [x] Student unregister flow in UI (button state, messages) wired to new DELETE endpoint.
- [x] Organizer upgrade UI: handle invalid/missing invite code error states with UX copy.
- [x] Participant attendance toggle: add backend tests and UI loading/error states.
- [x] Event validation: max length constraints, cover_url validation, password complexity; return structured errors.
- [x] Recommendations: exclude past events and respect capacity/full state.
- [x] Event pagination: add controls for page size selection and display total pages; update backend tests for page_size.
- [x] UI: add unit tests for 403/404 routing + auth guards.
- [x] CI pipeline (GitHub Actions): install deps, run backend tests, run UI checks.
- [x] CI: run Docker Compose build + smoke test (backend health + frontend).
- [x] Make sure emailing actually works, and configure it otherwise so that mails are being sent.
- [x] Fix frontend CI for the Vite/React UI (`npm test` script + Actions workflow step).
